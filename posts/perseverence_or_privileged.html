        <p>2020 hit the world economy hard, most of the countries economy saw a steep fall but
        between all this, a selected group of billionaires have made a great fortune, their wealth
        increased exponentially, we are talking about Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and
        all the big shareholders of S & P tech companies in here.</p>


        <p>US billionaires themselves have become $565 billion rich since March 18, according to a
        report published in Washington Dc based think tank Institute for Policy Studies, advocacy
        group Americans for Fair Taxation of Florida, in June. When nearly 42 million Americans
        were filing for initial unemployment benefits, which in present has reached around 52
        million, these billionaires were making an absolute killing, as the economy drops further,
        fairly or unfairly the rich could easily come into view as a scapegoat.</p>

        <p>So, how come these billionaires just keep getting rich even when the pandemic gets worse
        everyday?</p>

        <p>Most of us have wondered at least once in this lockdown period that how come these
        billionaires net worth keeps on soaring during this vast lockdown, from the first impression
        you might lead to think that this might be the case of the right place and the right time,
        however, this is not totally true, from this perspective we can totally define the tech
        billionaires net worth likes of Mr. Zuckerberg, but when on the other side Casino magnate
        Sheldon Adelson adds $5 billion to his net worth and Elon musk almost tripled his net worth
        which came mostly from his shares in Tesla - this unidirectional perspective doesn’t seem
        that much fit, so how come this all is happening?</p>

        <p>One day after the ides of March(16th march), DOW had the worst single-day drop in its
        history, but in just a 2 month period, seven of the world’s richest people witnessed an
        increase in their net worth by over 50%.</p>

        <p>Firstly, the surge in the wealth of the richest Americans is being mostly driven by the
        bounce-back of the stock markets in the US, primarily driven by unusual actions from the US
        Federal reserves.</p>

        <p>During this period around 52 million Americans are filing for unemployment benefits and on
        the other hand, the NASDAQ(stock market Index) has been reaching record highs. The US
        Fed’s emergency response to save businesses from drowning as crisis forewarned to surpass the Great Recession, included cutting interest to almost zero, which might last till 2022
        according to the Indian Express, and undertaking to buy unlimited amounts of bond- a
        backstop for landing markets which goes much further than what central bank did in the time
        of great recession. Fed flows nearly $4 trillion into the financial system over some years.
        These all lead to Fresh demand in assets such as stocks despite risky investments; Big tech
        companies and those linked to healthcare are among the major beneficiaries.</p>

        <p>Billionaires already have massive investing and purchasing power, and they have government
        resources to profit from during the economic recession additionally. Furthermore, the
        wealthy-friendly tax laws and loopholes assist them to save more tax. IRS rules allowed
        Amazon to pay nothing as tax for two years and when finally after 2016, the bill came, it was
        just 162 million dollars; 1.2% of the company’s earnings that year, even though corporate
        Fed tax is 21% in the US. Nevertheless, it’s not just Amazon, Taxes paid by billionaires have
        been reduced by 79% since 1980.</p>


          <blockquote class="blockquote">"One day after the ides of March(16th march), DOW had the worst single-day drop in its
        history, but in just a 2 month period, seven of the world’s richest people witnessed an
        increase in their net worth by over 50%.".</blockquote>

        <p>The severity could be realized by that, a 2012 study carried out by the Pressure group Tax
        justice network, found that as much as 32 trillion are being held offshore by billionaires.</p>

        <p>The second factor that contributes to the surged wealth is the Private charity foundations
        fueled by these billionaires. In 2010, Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren buffet together
        founded the organization, ‘The giving pledge’; whose primary goal is to inspire wealthy
        people to give half of their assets to philanthropy in their lifetime or after death, It has 210
        members now, mostly billionaires- their pledged money now totals at a staggering $1.2
        trillion.</p>

        <p>Some evidence came out after nearly one decade, according to the Guardian, 62 of these
        living pledgers’ net worth has increased by 95% from $376 billion to $ 734 billion in 2020.</p>

        <p>Instead of decreasing by half their money has now doubled.</p>

        <p>Pandemic just fueled their net worth, In just four months 100 billionaires who were part of
        The giving pledge saw their net worth increase by 28%.</p>

        <p>What happens is that most of these private charities are not more than tax-advantaged
        Intermediaries. These charities are often controlled by wealthy heirs and their advisors and
        this money doesn’t go in the ground level charity who are helping people on the ground level.
        Philanthropy is a private business but when it comes to these wealthy people, this is not the
        case. The taxpayers chip in 74 cents in every dollar in the lost tax revenue according to the
        guardians; the wealthier the donor the more tax they are saving on their money. Due to these
        reasons, private charities are the fastest growing sector in the giving sector. A private charity
        must have to give out 5% of its assets every year but this 5% is mostly spent on providing
        salaries and gifts to their employees. This is another big reason in the list why the rich keep
        getting richer.</p>

        <p>On the contrary, Amidst the Pandemic, there were everything shut down by the government
        but Internet-related businesses were allowed to keep running as the top billionaires on the list
        mostly consists of tech billionaires, made their net worth roar during the lockdown period,
        essential services companies in the medical field saw their net worth boosting exponentially.
        Some not very recognized platforms like Zoom also helped to boost its CEO net worth by
        $5.5 billion.</p>

        <p>On the national level, the extra rich also saw their net worth zooming, Mukesh Ambani who
        is 6th richest person in the world with a whooping net worth of $89 billion was just $36
        billion in the April 2020, an increase of around 150%- mostly which came from huge
        investment in Jio platforms from Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista and other dozen companies in
        just 10 days. Similarly, Shiv nadar, founder and chairman of HCL Technologies limited-
        India’s third largest software provider almost doubled his net worth in just 5 months, went
        from $12 billion to$ 22 billion. Gautam Adani went from $9 billion to $18 billion. Cyrus
        Poonewala, chairman of Serum Institute of india- world’s largest vaccine producer by the
        number of doses produced, was in limelight throughout the pandemic, climbed from $8.2
        billion to $11.5 billion in the pandemic period.</p>

        <p>Finally, there were tech and healthcare billionaires who get the most unprecedented monetary
        advantages from the Covid-19 period; but according to Indian Express, on the other hand,
        there were also 1062 billionaires who saw their wealth decline in the first three months and
        267 of them even dropped out of billionaire list. According to Forbes data, the combined net
        worth of billionaires dropped by $0.7 trillion in 2020. Billionaires are also not immune to the
        pandemic, it’s just the top billionaires who are covering all of their stories.</p>
